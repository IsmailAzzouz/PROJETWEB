prompt : it works after some tweaks ! now there's still work to do :

in ajax the grid as to get refreshed every seconds when it's our turn it's not refreshed till click on a valid cell
while the grid is the same as the grid before the refresh and it's still not our turn then we can't click on the cells (it just display an error alert but doesn't call update_grid)
the cells value is not show in html so it has to be
when the game is finished then if win the player winner has to be set winner in the database if draw the winner proprety is not touched but the isfinished boolean is set to true

that's all i see for now
